![App Demo](assets/demo_collage.png)

A comprehensive machine learning pipeline that predicts building entrances from GPS traces, demonstrating skills in computer vision, multimodal learning, and geospatial data processing - aligned with Maps ML Engineer requirements.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

This project implements a complete end-to-end pipeline:

1. **Raster Generation**: Downloads OpenStreetMap tiles for SF Bay Area localities
2. **Building Segmentation**: Simulates SAM (Segment Anything Model) to detect buildings
3. **Entrance Generation**: Creates ground truth entrance points based on building geometry
4. **GPS Simulation**: Generates realistic user movement patterns around buildings
5. **Deep Learning Model**: Predicts entrance locations from GPS trace patterns
6. **Visualization Platform**: Interactive web app to explore data and model predictions

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- CUDA-capable GPU (optional, for faster training)
- 2GB+ free disk space for data

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd geospatial-ml-pipeline

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Create required directories
mkdir -p data/{rasters,shapefiles,entrances,gps_traces,metadata,test}
mkdir -p models
mkdir -p templates static
```

### Running the Pipeline

Execute each step in order:

```bash
# Step 1: Generate raster files (satellite imagery)
python generate_raster.py
# This will download ~100 satellite images of SF Bay Area locations

# Step 2: Segment buildings from rasters
python segment_buildings.py
# Detects building footprints and saves as shapefiles

# Step 3: Generate entrance points
python generate_entrances.py
# Creates 1-5 entrances per building based on size

# Step 4: Simulate GPS traces
python simulate_gps.py
# Generates realistic user movement patterns

# Step 5: Train the ML model
python train_model.py
# Trains a neural network to predict entrances from GPS data

# Step 6: Launch visualization app
python app_updated.py
# Access at http://localhost:80
```

## 🔧 Key Components

### 1. Raster Generation (`generate_raster.py`)
- Downloads OpenStreetMap tiles at zoom level 18
- Focuses on key SF Bay Area locations
- Saves georeferenced PNG images with metadata

### 2. Building Segmentation (`segment_buildings.py`)
- Simulates SAM segmentation using edge detection
- Converts building masks to geographic polygons
- Filters by confidence threshold (60%)
- Exports as shapefiles and GeoJSON

### 3. Entrance Generation (`generate_entrances.py`)
- Maps building area to entrance count:
  - <100m²: 1 entrance
  - 100-500m²: 2 entrances
  - 500-1500m²: 3 entrances
  - 1500-5000m²: 4 entrances
  - >5000m²: 5 entrances
- Ensures minimum spacing between entrances
- Adds metadata (type, orientation)

### 4. GPS Simulation (`simulate_gps.py`)
- Generates realistic movement patterns:
  - Approach paths to buildings
  - Indoor movement with increased noise
  - Exit paths from buildings
- Adds GPS noise (3m standard deviation)
- Simulates 2-80 users per building

### 5. Deep Learning Model (`train_model.py`)
- **Architecture**: Fully connected neural network
  - Input: Spatial histogram of GPS points (8x8 grid)
  - Hidden layers: 128 → 256 → 128 neurons
  - Output: Heatmap of entrance probabilities
- **Training**: 
  - BCELoss with Adam optimizer
  - Learning rate scheduling
  - Train/Val/Test split: 60/20/20
- **Metrics**: Precision, Recall, F1 Score

### 6. Visualization Platform (`app_updated.py`)
- Interactive Leaflet map
- Layer controls for all data types
- Model prediction interface
- Real-time visualization updates

## 📊 Model Performance

The trained model achieves:
- **Precision**: ~0.75-0.85 (varies by dataset)
- **Recall**: ~0.70-0.80
- **F1 Score**: ~0.72-0.82

Performance depends on:
- GPS trace density
- Building complexity
- Number of entrances

## 🚧 Production Considerations

### For Real Deployment:

2. **Scale Data Pipeline**: Use distributed processing (Spark/Dask)
3. **Enhance Model**: 
   - Use transformer architectures
   - Add attention mechanisms
   - Incorporate building imagery
4. **Optimize Inference**: TensorRT/ONNX for faster predictions
5. **Add Authentication**: Secure the Flask app
6. **Deploy on Cloud**: Kubernetes for scalability

### Performance Optimizations:
- Batch processing for multiple buildings
- GPU acceleration for segmentation
- Caching for frequently accessed data
- CDN for static assets

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Rate Limiting on Tile Downloads**
   - Solution: Add delays or use local tile server
   
2. **Memory Issues with Large Datasets**
   - Solution: Process in smaller batches
   
3. **Model Not Found**
   - Solution: Ensure `train_model.py` completed successfully
   
4. **GPS Traces Missing**
   - Solution: Check if entrances were generated first
